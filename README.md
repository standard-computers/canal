# Building In-Progress
## Ratio â€“ An SAP Alternative

Ratio is an Open Source modular design Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system from A-Z once all basic functionality is completed. It's almost perfect that an ERP be publicly owned and built.

Each 'module' is a transaction code called a Locke. There's a list of all Locke codes as `Transaction Codes.xlsx` in ~/Documentation.

### Current Operations
At the moment, Ratio can create organizational structures and commit the buying process up to receiving, putting away, and moving product(s). You have the option to `use_deliveries`, which will enable your order process to revolve around deliveries versus Purchase Orders. Though this complicates the process, most enterprises revolve around orders being on trucks in deliveries. Deliveries enables Truck and Transportation Carrier management. Currently, you can have a Goods Receipt, Delivery, Sales Order, and a Ledger Commit autogenerated on Purchase Order creation.

Current storage mechanism is ~/Users/username/Roaming and unencrypted.

**GOAL:** Encrypted object storage with AES on Roaming folder or through AWS/MongoDB?

### Contributing
It is appreciated if all contributions are as enhancments and single-feature based. An example enhancement could be committed as 'Enhancement to /ORDS/NEW vendor selector'.

Any large build out or new process implementation should be a 'Project' and commit as 'Project `PROJECT_NAME`'. If you want to enable connections with AutoStore, do 'Project AutoStore'.

### Getting Started
_This will be a simple installation. Detailed to come._

First load of Ratio will present a setup view with no Locke code. Check 'New Install?' and import a zip file if you'd like but this assumes not. Ignore the 'Server' and 'Configuration' tabs. Ratio will open and require that you first make an Organization. Immediately after you will need to make an Employee, and create a User with that Employee ID. This will enable you to use Lockes. Once you have created a User, create a Ledger. You are are ready to start using Ratio.
