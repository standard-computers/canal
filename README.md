## Building In-Progress
## Getting Started

Canal is a modular design Enterprise Resource Planning system from A-Z once all basic functionality is completed. Regardless if any architecture decision, any ERP will be complex in nature for both code and documentation. It's almost perfect that an ERP be publicly owned and built.

Each 'module' is a transaction code. There's a list of all transctions codes as `Transaction Codes.xlsx` in ~/Documentation.

### Lack of OOP?
You'll notice a HEAVY lack of Object-Oriented Programming. This was done to enable customiziation on any 'module' without having to make too many architectural changes during the implementation process.

### Contributing
For the full wordage, verbage, and jargon, visit the wiki site.

It is appreciated if all contributions are as enhancments and singular-feature based. Change a single screw or gear at a time.

Any large build out or new process implementation should be a 'Project' and commit as 'Project `PROJECT_NAME`'. If you want to enable connections with AutoStore, do 'Project AutoStore'.
